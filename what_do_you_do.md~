# So what _else_ do you do?
(it's more computers)

## Hacking

- 4-year member of QUT White Hats
- Cert in PEH	
	- Not _that_ cert in ethical hacking
- Used to be an avid CTF player
	- Competition on intentionally vulnerable systems/software

## Hosting

- "Cloud" server
- Minecraft
- Ad blocking
- etc.
- Poorly defended, not giving out any URLs

---

## Open-source contributions

I work on what I use (mostly).
- Git tools
- Media players
- Web frameworks
- Phone/Web apps
- Hacking tools (once) 

```
                     /---------o
               /----/-----\
-----\--------/------------\------o
      \___________o
```

- I also do translations from German to English

- I do my best to ensure that, where possible, everything I use is open-source
	- This is not always feasible
	- I'm not a purist

# What's FOSS?
**F**ree  
**O**pen  
**S**ource  
**S**oftware  
- "It means that the software's source code is open for all and anyone is free to use, study and modify the code." - itsfoss.com
- It's this
- I'm using it
- You're using it
- That's using it
- That's probably using it

## But why?

- It's fun?
- Charity work but I'm good at it
- You have a right to build and modify your tools

## Do you benefit?

- I get stuff that I like made faster
- Software that I use (sometimes daily) gets improved in ways that benefit me (and others)
- If I get good enough, someone might pay me to do it
- Warm inner glow
